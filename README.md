# Happy Box



## Project Overview


### Website Purpose & Goals:

This website is designed as to provide users with a full ecommerce site and blog where they can order boxes with a selection of goods to make theirs or their loved ones lives happier. 

### Website Planning & Design Process:

#### 1. Initial Planning 

The planning commenced with pen and paper brainstorming and some competitor website analysis. Here ideas for an ecommerce site were considered. 

#### 2. User Stories

From here I decided to complete some user stories before commencing wireframing. This helped me to think through the user journey and design a good site map and navigation path. All user stories have been included in a file labelled "User Story" for project review.

#### 2. Wireframe

After the initial planning stage, analog pen and paper wireframes were completed. From here I developed these wireframes further using [Balsamiq](https://www.balsamiq.com "Balsamiq Homepage"). At this point I fine tuned down my features and layout. There were some cosmetic adjustments during the development process but on a whole the original mockups were followed quite closely. All wireframes have been included in a file labelled "Wireframe" for project review.

#### 2. Databse Schema Design

Using an AWS database, a relational database.
